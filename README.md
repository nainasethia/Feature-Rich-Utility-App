# Feature-Rich-Utility-App
This is my seventh Git Repository. In this, you'll see my Android Development: Feature-Rich Utility App Project. 
-	Developed a comprehensive Android application using Java and Android Studio, implementing a Relative Layout for optimal mobile UI.
-	Integrated Firebase services for backend operations, specifically implementing Firebase Authentication (Email/Password) and Firebase Realtime Database for storing and syncing user data.
-	Engineered core features, including user registration/login and a main menu that provides access to various utility functions.
-	Implemented multiple device utility features such as a Calculator (ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV), Torch control, Bluetooth toggling, Camera/Video Recording, Vibration control, Media Player, Wi-Fi toggling, Accelerometer functionality, and Light Sensor music control.
-	Managed project configuration, including setting up the Firebase project, downloading the google-services.json config file, adding required SDK dependencies, and defining necessary user permissions (e.g., Internet, Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Vibrate) in the AndroidManifest.xml.
